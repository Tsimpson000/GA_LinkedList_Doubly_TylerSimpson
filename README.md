# GA_LinkedList_Doubly_TylerSimpson
 
 A doubly linked list is a data structure of nodes that each point to both the previous and next nodes. This takes more
 memory than a singly, but is able to move forward and backward because of both pointers. The cross direction search makes
 it preferable to a singly linked list or an array.  Whick is something to consider when choosing, is cross direction
 search essential. Combining data structures can increase effeciency in both memory and search speed, but quickly becomes
 more complex to write.
